accommodation, sightseeing and short trips for travelers on behalf of tourism suppliers such as
airlines, car rental companies, hotels, railways and cruise ships.

570 passengers and reasonable amenities at cheaper fares making it the first packaged tour. The
travel agency has significantly evolved through 20th century and much technological
